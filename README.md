# This Project is a Work in Progress
Even _IF_ I am able to get all of my compilations and software working to get hardware video decoding working on an Odroid N2Plus board (running Ubuntu Server); there is still the monumental task of creating various daemons that listen for updates from various repositories and recompile and release updates.  And even after that -- there is then the task of creating some kind of updater routine that runs on the N2Plus itself, so that it stays up-to-date with the various releases.
